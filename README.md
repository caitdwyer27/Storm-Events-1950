# **Storm Events in 1950**
### This repository was created for Prof. Gotzler's English 105 class in the Spring 2024 semester at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
- It contains the raw data sets of storm events in 1950, specifically tornados, in csv form.
- It contains a subset created from the original data set of direct injuries by month
- It also provides the Python notebook that includes instructional directions for creating the subset

## Purpose of This Repository
- The purpose of this repository is to provide statistical data on the effects of tornadoes in the United States by year
- It brings awareness to the lives that have been lost, the damages caused, and the injuries incurred

## Where the Data is From
- This dataset has been downloaded from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information [
](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/)

## What This Data Can be Used for
- This data can be used to make observations of common states where tornadoes occur, months with the most negative effects, etc.
- Using this data, scientists within weather/climate fields may develop statistical-based damage solutions

## Visualization
- This graph visualizes the amount of direct injuries caused by tornadoes, organized by month
